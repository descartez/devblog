### Uh, what?

Boredom. It's good.

### But... why?

It's become increasingly clear that boredom is [pretty](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jul/30/bored-children-boredom-parents) [dang](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/boredom-can-be-good-for-you.html) [important](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/hide-and-seek/201407/the-surprising-benefits-boredom).

Boredom is the key to creativity. An occupied mind isn't the most introspective one. It's too busy. Boredom comes from silent moments where you have nothing to do _but_ think. That is, if you allow yourself.

### Bored? Be Less Boring.

That's a bit harsh. I'm not trying to say that being bored means you are boring. What I do mean is that boredom is an _opportunity_. It's a way to be motivated. To quote one of the above linked articles:

Being bored means thinking. It means considering why you are bored. Often much of my design choices come down to "do I really want to do this __again__?"
