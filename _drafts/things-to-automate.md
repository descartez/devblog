A list of things you should automate:

- Emails that have the same answer every time
  - i.e. "What time is the event?" (says every co-worker who did not read the flyer)
-Appointment reminders
  - It's difficult to find a calendar app that doesn't do this in this day and age.
- Site/app skeleton generation
  - I have a couple scripts that do this, taking files and frameworks that I use every time and copy them into new directories
- Tests
  - It makes tracking down bugs easier. WAY easier.

Things to __NOT__ automate:

- Important personal interactions
